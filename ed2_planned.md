# Ideas for a possible second edition of *Julia Quick Syntax Reference*

_Please either note your idea (or wishlist) for subjects to be included in a possible second edition of this book directly on this file (clone the repository -> make your modification -> make a pull request) or write a note using the forum on [julia-book.com](https://julia-book.com)._


## Extend discussion on packages to better describe modules and their relation with packages

- Add the following check if a package is already installed: `using Pkg; haskey(Pkg.installed(), "NameOfMyPackage")`

## New chapter (or section) to _create and register_ packages ? (but maybe out of scopus for a beginner book? )
## Add a section on Dates/Times types
## Add a section on the new Thread API

## Discuss the following extra packages:

- Distributions
- Revise
- PackageCompiler
- https://github.com/pszufe/OpenStreetMapX.jl
- https://github.com/pszufe/OpenStreetMapXPlot.jl

## Miscelaneous:

- Add `count(predicate, myArray)`
